Predicting Career Length of NBA Players
Problem Statement

We are trying to predict the career length of a NBA player i.e. whether an NBA player will play for next 5 years?

Business Case 

By using a predictive model like this to identify which players are likely to play for at least 5 years, 
NBA teams can make more informed decisions about which players to draft, sign, or trade. This can help teams avoid selecting or acquiring players who are more likely to retire early or suffer from career-ending injuries.
NBA teams often have limited resources to acquire players, so it's important to make every signing or trade count.
By using a predictive model to identify players who are likely to play for at least 5 years, teams can focus their resources on those players and avoid wasting resources on players who are more likely to retire early or suffer from career-ending injuries.
